                    <h4>1) Your Favourite Dialogue and Why?</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>"Anybody who uses computers doesn’t know a damn thing about this game." – Gus Lobel
                    <h5>Why it's my favorite:</h5>
                    This line captures the central tension of the movie: the battle between traditional wisdom and
                    modern technology. Gus represents the old-school scouts who rely on intuition, experience, and
                    human connection — not just data. In a world obsessed with stats and analytics, this line
                    reminds us that human instincts and emotions still matter, especially in people-centric
                    professions like scouting or coaching.</p>

                    <h4>2) Your Personal Review?</h4>

                    <p>
                        “Trouble with the Curve” is an emotional, character-driven drama that blends sports, family, and
                        aging. I liked how the story revolves not just around baseball but also around complex
                        relationships — especially between a father and daughter. Clint Eastwood plays Gus with gritty
                        realism, while Amy Adams shines as Mickey, the daughter caught between her career and her
                        father's legacy.
                        <br>
                        It’s not your typical sports movie — it's more about people than performance. The pacing is a
                        bit slow at times, but the performances and message make up for it.

                    <h4>3) Learning to Take Away from the Movie</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Experience is invaluable. Data can support decisions, but human judgment adds a dimension that
                        algorithms can’t.
                        <br>

                        Listening is a skill. Gus might be tough, but he "listens" to the game and to people in ways
                        machines can't replicate.
                        <br>

                        Balance tradition and innovation. Both analytics and instincts are essential — one shouldn’t
                        completely replace the other.
                        <br>

                        Relationships matter. The father-daughter dynamic shows how communication gaps can lead to
                        emotional distance, but also how reconciliation is always possible.
